# RosalindSolutions
This repo contains my solutions to the Rosalind problem set, in the form of functions.
Depending on the function the input format can change. If a FASTA is provided there is a
function at the top that can convert a FASTA into a dictionary with IDs as the key and sequences
as the value. Rosalind problem name and ID will be located above each of the functions and a * 
represents the function is complete. Functions that I am still working on should be noted as 
"In Progress".
