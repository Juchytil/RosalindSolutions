# RosalindSolutions
## This repo contains my solutions to the Rosalind problem set, in the form of functions.
## Depending on the function the input format can change. If a VCF is provided there is a 
## function at the top that can convert a VCF into a dictionary with IDs as the key and sequences
## as the value.
